## 📌 Task Descriptions

### ✅ Task 1 – Number Guessing Game
A simple console-based game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
The user tries to guess it, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, until the correct number is guessed. The number of attempts is also displayed.

### ✅ Task 2 – Simple Calculator
A basic calculator program that accepts two numbers and then asks the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). It performs the selected arithmetic operation and handles division by zero and invalid input gracefully.

### ✅ Task 4 – To-Do List Manager
A console-based task manager that allows the user to add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks.  
Each task is displayed with its status (`Completed` or `Pending`) and a simple menu guides the user through operations. Input validation ensures smooth user interaction.
